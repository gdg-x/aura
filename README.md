## What we're about

The Google Developers Group Galway is a community regrouping Tech aficionados based in our beautiful city of Galway, Ireland. We organize events focused on new technologies, Google products and services, but also workshops, competitions, and networking events. We invite people from all backgrounds and technical level to join our community on Twitter, Discord, and Meetup group! Disclaimer: GDG Galway is an independent group; our activities and the opinions expressed here should in no way be linked to the Google Corporation.

## What is this project?

It is our official website! You can check it out at https://gdg-galway.com/. If at any point you feel like contributing to the project, feel free to pull our codebase and commit your changes! We would love to see more people working on this.

The project is using VueJS (https://vuejs.org/) and Firebase (https://firebase.google.com) as core technologies. The template used was provided by GDG Jalandhar (https://meetup.com/GDG-Jalandhar/) who did an amazing job putting this together!

Let's start coding :)
